# RealTimeCodeEditor Application

RealTimeCodeEditor is a dynamic, real-time collaborative code editor built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The application allows users to join collaborative coding sessions from anywhere in the world, enabling live coding with real-time collaboration. Users can join a coding room using a unique room ID, edit or write code, and the app will display "User is Typing" as they type. The editor supports multiple programming languages such as Python, C++, Java, and JavaScript. When a user selects a language from the dropdown, the app automatically configures the environment accordingly, ensuring that the right syntax highlighting, formatting, and features are available for that specific language. This dynamic setup makes it easy for users to collaborate across various programming languages in a seamless manner. Whether you're working on Python scripts, Java applications, or C++ projects, the RealTimeCodeEditor adapts to provide a tailored coding experience.
